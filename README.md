👋 Hi, I’m @zohoDeveloperGit

👀 I’m interested in developing custom Zoho solutions, automating business processes, and helping businesses streamline their workflows across various industries like healthcare, construction, IT, and education.

🌱 I’m currently learning advanced integrations within the Zoho ecosystem and exploring new ways to optimize processes using AI and machine learning.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to Zoho CRM, Zoho Creator, Zoho Analytics, and automation solutions to improve business efficiencies.
